**Memory Game Project**

This project is a standard memeroy game where you can pick two cards. After a card is clicked, a color will appear. 
If the colors on both cards don't match, the cards will flip back over and two new cards can be clicked. Once two cards with the same cards are picked, the colors will stay facing up.
Once all the cards are matched, the game is complete.
